## MPSoC_Adapters

This repository implements a set of c++ classes wrapping the Xilinx Vitis SDK drivers for Xilinx soft core peripheral
devices. The classes, termed `Adapters` provide a streamlined manner to initialize softcore peripherals and 
their associated interrupts within the object-oriented paradigm of C++. Support is currently provided for Xilinx FreeRTOS
implementations with plans to add baremetal support and perhaps additional real time operating systems.
